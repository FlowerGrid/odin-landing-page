# odin-landing-page
The Landing Page assignment from The Odin Project

This project is an exercise is recreating the visual flow of a webpage using html and css<br>
making heavy use of the flexbox tool.

<br><br>
I think it looks pretty close to the reference. <br>
I made it look like a business (my coverband), as suggested.
<br>
I even gave it live links
<br><br>
I make change it to a ficticious company later for portfolio purposes
